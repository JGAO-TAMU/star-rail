# star-rail

This tool opens Honkai: Star Rail and automatically spends resin to farm materials. It also automatically claims rewards from daily missions. 
You will need administrator rights for this to work. If using an IDE, run as administrator. maybe I will make it executable in the future.

Warning: While I haven't been banned while testing or using this, it is probably against the game's TOS. Proceed at your own risk.

To use:

In your game files, find the path to your StarRail.exe file and update the field in the gui. It might look something like this: C:Program Files\Star Rail\Games\StarRail.exe

select the domain and material you want to farm. 

click "play star rail"

The game should open and begin farming materials. When you are out of resin, it will collect your daily rewards.
